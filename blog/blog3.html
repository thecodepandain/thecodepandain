				<p>Getting confused about where to start competitive coding……</p>
				<p>Competitive coding is a vast topic in the field of programing language and can be really frustrating and confusing to find from where to start and from where to not.</p>
				<p>Mr. Guy, one of our characters were similarly confused just like you and then he got advice from Rubics. let's see, what Rubics has to say about it.</p>
				<blockquote>
					Competitive Coding is a challenging art and for mastering it you need to practice by solving coding challenges. But as a beginner, you might not know the websites on which coding competitions are held. Rubics mastered by solving and practicing, here are the sites he listed for you and Mr. guy :

				<h5><a href="https://www.hackerearth.com/"><b>HackerEarth</b></a></h5>
				<p>
					I was excited to use HackerEarth as it is an Indian company and has a network of top developers across the world.
				</p>
				<strong>Pros-</strong>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						It holds coding competitions for all and also conducts competitions in different colleges in India.
					</li>
					<li>
						It engages people by holding hakerthorn and 9-day challenging programs and scoring them.
					</li>
					<li>
						I liked their scoring method, they exactly let you know where you went wrong and you can know your strengths and weakness.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<strong>Cons –</strong>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						People often get confused with it and hakerrank , but friends let me clarify these are two different platforms.
					</li>
					<li>
						No such cons, I loved using it, it just needs to make their human interface better.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<h5><a href="https://www.codechef.com/"><b>CodeChef</b></a></h5>
				<p>
					CodeChef is another leading Indian company with programmers around the globe and is one of the top Competitive Programming platforms. It holds three contests every month, short contests, and give away prizes and goodies. Apart from these it all partners with institutions and student communities to create workshops, orientation, and content.
				</p>
				<strong>Pros-</strong>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						You can also learn about Completive Coding, you can also code in their IDE editor.
					</li>
					<li>
						It holds a month-long competition, which helped me to improve my problem-solving skills.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<strong>Cons –</strong>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						I read it on Quora, it has more mathematical questions.
					</li>
					<li>
						A month-long challenge can be exhausting, and sometimes its answers are posted online which is unfair for participants.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Hoping you all along with Mr. guy is noting everything down.
				</p>
				<p>
					Getting bored?! <a href="https://instagram.com/thecodepanda.in">Connect</a> with us.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h5><a href="https://thecodepanda.in/"><b>Thecodepanda.in</b></a></h5>
				<p>
					The code panda is a fantastic website to sharpen your programming skills and if you are a beginner you can also enter through a simple story-based programming doorway of the programming world. It has a story-based learning module that helps the users to get a better understanding of the programming language that they are seeking.

					It also provides a load of questions from beginner to advance level so that despite your coding level you can practice questions on the inbuilt <a href="https://thecodepanda.in/pandalab/">IDLE</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The cherry on the cake is that one can also get expert advice from the advanced level coders on the platform and will never have the fear of getting stuck again.
				</p>
				<br>
				
				<h5><a href="https://www.topcoder.com/"><b>TopCoder</b></a></h5>

					</li>
					<li>

					</li>
				</ul>
				<br>

				<h5><a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/"><b>HakerRank</b></a></h5>

					This was the list I created with my own experience. Don’t be confused all you need is To practice and to ace you need the help from these amazing sites. consistency and never getting distracted are important. it is never too late.
